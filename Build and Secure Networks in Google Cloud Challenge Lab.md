# Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

## The challenge contains 6 required tasks
1. Remove the overly permissive rules.
2. Start the bastion host instance.
3. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion.
4. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop.
5. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from the acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop.
6. SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion. 

### Task 1. Create the production environment
    The first step is to create open-access firewall rules.
    In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
    Click on the box next to the rule named open-access.
    Then Click on Delete to remove.
    
### 2. Start the bastion host instance
    In this step, you have a virtual machine and want to start.
    In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Compute Engine > VM Instance.
    Click on the box next to the instance named bastion.
    Click on Start to run the instance.
    
### 3.Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion
In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service.

    Add network tag on bastion VM.
    Go to the VM Instance page, click on the bastion instance and click the Edit option
    Now Add bastion to the Network tags field.
    At the end of the page click Save.
    
    Now you have to create a firewall for bastion:
    In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
    Click Create firewall rule.
    Configure the following settings:
    Field- Value
    Name- e.g. allow-ssh-from-iap
    Direction of traffic- Ingress
    Targets- Specified target tags
    Target tags-bastion
    Source IP ranges- 35.235.240.0/20
    Protocols and ports- Select TCP and enter 22 to allow SSH
    
### 4. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop
    In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address.
    In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall.
    Click Create firewall rule.
    Configure the following settings:
    Field- Value
    Name- e.g. allow-http-ingress
    Direction of traffic- Ingress
    Targets- Specified target tags
    Target tags-juice-shop
    Source IP ranges-0.0.0.0/0
    Protocols and ports- Select TCP and enter 80 to allow HTTP
    
    Add network tag on juice-shop VM.
    Go to the VM Instance page, click on the juice-shop instance and click the Edit option
    Now Add juice-shop to the Network tags field.
    At the end of the page click Save.
    
### 5.Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop

    In this step, you have to create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address.
    In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network.
    Copy the IP address of the aceme-mgmt-subnet.
    
    In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >VPC Network > Firewall> Firewall Rules.
    Click Create firewall rule.
    Configure the following settings:
    Field- Value
    Name- e.g.allow-ssh-from-mgmt-subnet
    Direction of traffic- Ingress
    Targets- Specified target tags
    Target tags-bastion,juice-shop
    Source IP ranges- IP address range of your aceme-mgmt-subnet
    Protocols and ports- Select TCP and enter 22 to allow SSH.

### 6.SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion

    After configuring the firewall rules, try to verify the environment via the bastion.
    In the GCP Console go to Navigation Menu >Compute Engine > VM Instance.
    Copy the Internal IP of the juice-shop instance.
    Then click on the SSH button in the row of the bastion instance.
    From the SSH console, access the juice-shop from the bastion using the following command:

    ssh <internal-IP-of-juice-shop>
    
    Note:Replace <internal-IP-of-juice-shop> with Internal IP
